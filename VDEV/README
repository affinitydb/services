"VDEV" stands for virtual device.

This service is intended primarily for documentation and demonstration purposes.
Each instance of this service maintains a state (according to a configurable data model)
and provides typical service access to that state.  This is useful to:

  1. demonstrate how to interact with services
  2. show how to implement services
  3. provide a hardware-free environment for those demonstrations,
     that can run in our online documentation for example

This service will be packaged with our documentation.
